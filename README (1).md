Props vs State 
Props(Properties) - inputs passed to a component  - Similar to function Arguments
immutable - not changeable - readonly


State - Internal data managed by a component that can change overtime  - Local Variables 
Mutable - data can be changed overtime 


they both have in common in terms of re-rendering data and update DOM accordingly
